# SaaS-project
 A hands-on project focused on applying a SaaS AI development system

## Overview
This project implements a fraud detection system leveraging **Google Cloud's AI Platform** and **BigQuery** as a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution. The system builds an automated machine learning pipeline for real-time fraud detection using public datasets, advanced AutoML techniques, and scalable deployment through Google Cloud services.

## Features
- **Data Processing:** Uses BigQuery to extract, transform, and load large datasets.
- **Automated Model Training:** Implements AutoML for fraud classification and optimized for precision and recall.
- **Real-time Predictions:** Deployed with Google Cloud's Vertex AI endpoints for real-time fraud detection.
- **Model Explainability:** Provides feature attribution and explainability reports to understand the modelâ€™s predictions.
- **Batch and Real-time Inference:** Handles both batch processing and real-time prediction use cases.
- **Cloud-based Deployment:** Fully managed and scalable cloud infrastructure using Google Cloud services.
